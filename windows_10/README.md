* disable-tasks.ps1
* disable-services.ps1
* disable-cortana.ps1
* disable-telemetry.ps1
* remove-apps.ps1
* hosts-blocklist.ps1 telemetry_hosts.txt

## Specific Information

Note: Cleanup folder contains scripts which could cause problems with Windows Components as it removes unwanted applications / components.

### Added 1803

Added new script to remove Microsoft Edge browser as it now seems to run in the background for some reason.

The remove cortana cleanup (searchui.exe) script sometimes errors as the process doesn't seem to close but works if you run multiple times.

Microsoft also seem to have removed the GPO for disabling cortana in Software Policies.

### Added 1703

I have added a new folder for Windows 10 Creators Update as I have a custom ISO with Cortana, Windows Store & all Store Apps removed.

Still testing this but it seems much better as there are no store shortcuts on start menu (eg: minecraft) & less background processes running.

### disable-telemetry

Disable Telemetry & Related Items in Windows 10 Using Software Policies

    >> Disabling Telemetry in SOFTWARE Policies
    >> Disabling Problem Steps Recorder in SOFTWARE Policies
    >> Disabling Application Impact Telemetry in SOFTWARE Policies
    >> Disabling Customer Experience Improvement Program in SOFTWARE Policies

**Microsoft Customer Experience Improvement Program**

CEIP collects information about how our customers use Microsoft programs and about some of the problems they encounter. Microsoft uses this information to improve the products and features customers use most often and to help solve problems. Participation in the program is voluntary, and the end results are software improvements to better meet the needs of our customers.

**Problem Steps Recorder:**

Problem Steps Recorder automatically captures the steps you take on a computer, including a text description of where you clicked and a screenshot during each click. Once you capture these steps, you can save them to a file that can be used by a support professional or someone else helping you with a computer problem.

Note: some people/companies may want to keep Problem Steps Recorder enabled.

If you only want to disable telemetry:

    If (-Not (Test-Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection"))
    {
        New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows" -Name DataCollection
    }
    sp "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection" "AllowTelemetry" 0
    sp "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection" "AllowTelemetry" 0

### disable-services

Disables a lot of built-in Windows Services which could be considered privacy
or security risks due to the information they collect.

Examples:

    Data Collection and Publishing Service
    Microsoft (R) Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector Service
    Diagnostics Tracking Service
    Geolocation Service
    Remote Registry
    Windows Biometric Service
    Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service

### set-windowsupdate

Sets Windows Update to Notify Before Downloading Available Updates.

The default settings for Windows 10 is to automatically download & install updates.

### hosts-blocklist

Block Hostnames From A Blocklist Using HOSTS file in windows

example to show how it works:

    > ping watson.live.com
    Pinging watson.live.com [207.46.223.94] with 32 bytes of data:
    > .\hosts-blocklist.ps1 .\telemetry_hosts.txt
    > ping watson.live.com
    Ping request could not find host watson.live.com. Please check the name and try again.

I've found a lot of hosts files regarding telemetry and have added one to this repo to make it easier but if you have any additions, please comment.
Also a lot of the hosts lists I found blocked skype & other applications.

### fw-blocklist

Block a list of IP Addresses in Windows Firewall

### remove-apps

Cleans up all possible appstore applications from windows.

Some apps however cannot be removed using this script as they are considered system applications.

    Non-Removable Applications :
                    Microsoft.BioEnrollment
                    Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge
                    Microsoft.Windows.Cortana
                    Microsoft.WindowsFeedback
                    Microsoft.XboxGameCallableUI
                    Microsoft.XboxIdentityProvider
                    Windows.ContactSupport

## cleanup/

### rem-onedrive

Removes onedrive by running uninstaller in background & reloading explorer

### rem-sysapps

Moves system apps related to telemetry/error reporting & also moves cortana to stop SearchUI.exe from spawning (useful if you do not use or need cortana)

Make sure you hide cortana on system/start bar BEFORE running rem-sysapps

<details>
  <summary>Known Bugs / Issues</summary>
Running rem-sysapps with cortana shown on taskbar can cause error when trying to move folders as process respawns too quickly

ERROR: mv : The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.

Setting the Cortana searchbar to hidden before running script should fix
